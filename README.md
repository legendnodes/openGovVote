# OpenGov
Polkadot &amp; Kusama openGov voting with CLI

The script allows users to easily broadcast votes for multiple referendums from multiple addresses via proxy account, for both Polkadot and Kusama networks.

The voting process is as follows:
1) Choose whether you want to use default values or not (pre-set addresses/amounts)? (y/n).
2) If yes, follow steps 4-6 only.
3) If not, follow all the steps.
4) Choose a network - polkadot or kusama.
5) Enter referendums you want to vote (comma separated).
6) Enter vote type for each referendum (aye/nay).
7) Enter conviction per each referendum (1-6).
8) Enter a proxied address.
9) Choose the amount of DOT/KSM - note: you can choose the same amount for all referendums.
10) Upon request, you can add another proxied account and restart the process, or move directly to broadcast your votes.
