# OpenGov
Polkadot &amp; Kusama openGov voting with CLI

The script allows user to easily broadcast votes for multiple referendums from multiple addresses via proxy account, for both Polkadot and Kusama networks.

The voting process is as follows:
1) Choose whether you want to use default values or not (pre-set addresses/amounts)? (y/n)
2) If yes, follow steps 4-6 below only
3) If no, following all the steps below
4) Choose which network he wishes to vote - polkadot or kusama
5) Enter the referendums he wants to vote (comma separated)
6) Enter vote type (aye/nay) for each referendum
7) Enter conviction per each referndum
8) Enter proxied address
9) Choose amount of DOT/KSM - note: you can choose the same amount for all referendums
10) Adding another proxied account and start the process again, or moving on to broadcast the user inputs
  
For safety, it's recommended to use proxy account with minimal amount of tokens only for the transactions fees
